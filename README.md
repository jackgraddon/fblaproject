# FBLA Web Design Project

## Task
Create a website for a new business in your local community, region, or state. The website must include the business name, photos, and description for the entity. The website must include a minimum of four web pages, including a contact us page and embedded features. The website should feature social media and marketing material to promote the new business. 

## Getting Started
I began working on this project shortly after the challenge topic was announced. I drew up sketches in Pixelmator Pro of what I wanted the site to look like, and asked for feedback on the layout from my peers. After some tweaks, I opened Visual Studio Code to begin transforming my vision into a tangible product. I completed the final product in early Janurary, 2022, which allowed me to begin working on the presentation.

## Final Product
I created a website for a mock business, Generated Prints, that specialises in selling art prints that are completely generated by artificial intelligence. Some examples of the sites assets, screenshots, and links to view the site live are below.
